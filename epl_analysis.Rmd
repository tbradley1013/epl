#Introduction
In honor of the start of a new season for the English Premier League (EPL), I am putting together this exploratory data analysis of historical EPL data to see how teams typically do to start a season. 

#General Data Analysis
```{r libraries}
# loading in the required packages
suppressWarnings(suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(dplyr)
  library(tidyr)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(lubridate)
  library(magrittr)
  library(tidyquant)
  library(purrr)
  library(ggjoy)
}))
```

First, we will load in the data. All of the data used in this analysis is from www.football-data.co.uk. 

```{r read-files}
files <- list.files(path = "epl_results", full.names = TRUE)

raw_data <- map(files, read.csv)
```


Below is the column information provided by the website:
    Div = League Division
    Date = Match Date (dd/mm/yy)
    HomeTeam = Home Team
    AwayTeam = Away Team
    FTHG and HG = Full Time Home Team Goals
    FTAG and AG = Full Time Away Team Goals
    FTR and Res = Full Time Result (H=Home Win, D=Draw, A=Away Win) 
    HTHG = Half Time Home Team Goals 
    HTAG = Half Time Away Team Goals 
    HTR = Half Time Result (H=Home Win, D=Draw, A=Away Win)

Match Statistics (where available)
    Attendance = Crowd Attendance
    Referee = Match Referee
    HS = Home Team Shots
    AS = Away Team Shots
    HST = Home Team Shots on Target
    AST = Away Team Shots on Target
    HHW = Home Team Hit Woodwork
    AHW = Away Team Hit Woodwork
    HC = Home Team Corners
    AC = Away Team Corners
    HF = Home Team Fouls Committed
    AF = Away Team Fouls Committed
    HO = Home Team Offsides
    AO = Away Team Offsides
    HY = Home Team Yellow Cards
    AY = Away Team Yellow Cards
    HR = Home Team Red Cards
    AR = Away Team Red Cards
    
There are more columns provided in the raw data set that have to do with betting odds, however, we will remove them as they are not going to be used in this analysis. Additionally, only two seasons data has attendance recorded, so this will be removed. Looking through the data, all of the data sets for the 2000/2001 through the 2016/2017 seasons have all of tje match statistics listed above. The data sets prior to the 2000/2001 data set only have the general data and none of the match statistics.  Becasue of these differences in available data we will only use the general statistics for the first part of this analysis. 

```{r combine-data}
data_general <- map(raw_data, function(x){
  output <- x %>%
    filter(Date != "") %>%  #the csv files pulled in some extra rows, this line removes them
    mutate(Date = dmy(Date)) %>% #converting the Date column from a factor to date object
    select(Div:HTR) %>%
    mutate(season = ifelse(month(Date) > 7,
                                   year(Date) + 1,
                                    year(Date)))  #creating a reference date 
  return(output)
})

data <- do.call(rbind, data_general) %>% as.tibble()
```


```{r show-combined, results = "hide"}
data 
```

```{r output-show-combined}
# # A tibble: 8,360 x 11

# # ... with 8,350 more rows
```

Now that the data from the csv files is all in one data frame, we can do some manipulation to get it into a more tidy format. 

```{r tidy-data, results = "hide"}
data_tidy <- data %>%
  gather(key = "venue", value = team, HomeTeam:AwayTeam) %>% 
  arrange(Date) %>%
  mutate_if(is.factor, as.character) %>%
  mutate(venue = ifelse(venue == "HomeTeam",
                        "Home",
                        "Away"),
         FTR = case_when(venue == "Home" & FTR == "H" ~ "W",
                         venue == "Home" & FTR == "A" ~ "L",
                         venue == "Away" & FTR == "H" ~ "L",
                         venue == "Away" & FTR == "A" ~ "W",
                         TRUE ~ FTR),
         HTR = case_when(venue == "Home" & HTR == "H" ~ "W",
                         venue == "Home" & HTR == "A" ~ "L",
                         venue == "Away" & HTR == "H" ~ "L",
                         venue == "Away" & HTR == "A" ~ "W",
                         TRUE ~ HTR),
         FTGF = ifelse(venue == "Home", FTHG, FTAG),  #Full Time Goals For
         FTGA = ifelse(venue == "Home", FTAG, FTHG),  #Full Time Goals Against
         HTGF = ifelse(venue == "Home", HTHG, HTAG),  #Half Time Goals For
         HTGA = ifelse(venue == "Home", HTAG, HTHG),  #Half Time Goals Against
         points_earned = case_when(FTR == "W" ~ 3,           #adding points
                                   FTR == "D" ~ 1,
                                   FTR == "L" ~ 0)) %>% 
  select(Div, season, Date, team, venue, FTR, FTGF, FTGA, HTR, HTGF, HTGA, points_earned) %>%
  group_by(season, team) %>%
  mutate(points = cumsum(points_earned)) %>% #calculating the number of points each team has through out the season
  ungroup()

data_tidy
```

```{r show-tidy-data}
# # A tibble: 16,720 x 13

# # ... with 16,710 more rows
```

To ensure that our tidying did not create any missing values, we can use the `summarise_all()` function.

```{r check-NA, results = "hide"}
data_tidy %>% 
  summarise_all(function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

```{r show-check-NA}
# # A tibble: 1 x 11
#     Div season  Date  team venue   FTR  FTGF  FTGA   HTR  HTGF  HTGA
#   <int>  <int> <int> <int> <int> <int> <int> <int> <int> <int> <int>
# 1     0      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
```

Now that we know that the data is in a tidy format, we can begin exploring the data. As an Arsenal fan, I think we should start by looking at how Arsenal has done each year. 

```{r arsenal-points-graph-1, fig.width=12, fig.height=7}
data_tidy %>%
  filter(team == "Arsenal",
         season < 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Date, points)) +
  facet_wrap(~season, scales = "free") +
  geom_line() +
  theme_tq() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%m/%d") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) +
  labs(x = "", 
       y = "Point Tally",
       title = "Arsenal Point Tally over the course of each season from the 1995/1996 season to the 2005/2006 season")

```

```{r arsenal-points-graph-2, fig.width=12, fig.height=7}
data_tidy %>%
  filter(team == "Arsenal",
         season >= 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Date, points)) +
  facet_wrap(~season, scales = "free") +
  geom_line() +
  theme_tq() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%m/%d") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12))+
  labs(x = "", 
       y = "Point Tally",
       title = "Arsenal Point Tally over the course of each season from the 2006/2007 season to the 2016/2017 season")

```

From these graphs, it looks like Arsenal follow a similar pattern every year, which is not surprising since the 2017 season was the first in Arsene Wenger's tenure that they have not finised in the top 4. Looking at the plot for the 2017 season, it is clear that the period of the season that killed their chances of finishing in the top 4 was the strech of games between Februrary and March where their point increase flat lined. Let's now take a look at team's average finishing point total.

```{r season-ending-points, results = "hide"}
season_ending <- data_tidy %>%
  group_by(season, team) %>%
  summarise(final_points = max(points), final_goals_for = sum(FTGF), final_goals_against = sum(FTGA)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  mutate(table_position = 20 - rank(final_points, ties.method = "min")) %>%
  ungroup()
  
season_ending
```

```{r show-season-ending-points}
# # A tibble: 440 x 6
#    season        team final_points final_goals_for final_goals_against table_position
#     <dbl>       <chr>        <dbl>           <int>               <int>          <dbl>
#  1   1996     Arsenal           63              49                  32              4
#  2   1996 Aston Villa           63              52                  35              4
#  3   1996   Blackburn           61              61                  47              7
#  4   1996      Bolton           29              39                  71             19
#  5   1996     Chelsea           50              46                  44             10
#  6   1996    Coventry           38              42                  60             17
#  7   1996     Everton           61              64                  44              7
#  8   1996       Leeds           43              40                  57             12
#  9   1996   Liverpool           71              70                  34              2
# 10   1996    Man City           38              33                  58             17
# # ... with 430 more rows
```

From this output, right away we can see that point ties result in the rank function returning a tie. The EPL determines ties first by highest number of goals for, and then by head to head match-ups. Looking at this first example of the tie between Arsenal and Aston Villa, we can see that Aston Villa had 3 more goals for, meaning they finished 4th and Arsenal finished 5th. For now, we won't worry about fixing these ties. 

```{r season-ending-summary, results = "hide"}
season_ending_stats <- season_ending %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  summarise(avg_final_points = round(mean(final_points), 0), 
            sd_final_points = round(sd(final_points), 0), 
            avg_final_goals_for = round(mean(final_goals_for), 0), 
            sd_final_goals_for = round(sd(final_goals_for), 0),
            avg_final_goals_against = round(mean(final_goals_against), 0),

# # ... with 36 more rows, and 3 more variables: avg_table_position <dbl>, sd_table_poisiton <dbl>, num_seasons <int>
```

As we can see from the tibble summary, there are several teams that have only been in the premier league for a single year, resulting in NaN values for the standard deviation columns. To avoid cluttering the next graph, we will remove any teams that have not been in the premier league for at least 10 of the 22 seasons being analyzed. 

```{r bar-graph-season-stats, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 7}
season_ending_stats %>%
  filter(num_seasons >= 10) %>%
  arrange(-avg_final_points) %>%
  mutate(team = factor(team, team)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(team, avg_final_points)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "red") +
  geom_point(color = "navy") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = avg_final_points - 2*sd_final_points, ymax = avg_final_points + 2*sd_final_points), color = "navy", size = 1) +
  theme_tq() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) +
  labs(x = "Team",
       y = "Final Points",
       title = "Average Final Points from 1995/1996 season to 2016/2017 season",
       subtitle = "Only teams with 10 or more seasons in the EPL were included")

```

It looks like Manchester United have the highest average final points per season. They are followed closely by Arsenal and Chelsea, who are then closely followed by Liverpool, Manchester City, and Tottenham. It is worth noting that Chelsea and Manchester City both have much higher error associated with their mean value, indicating they have much more fluctuation in the final point tallies. Another interesting take away from this figure is that the lowest average final point tally for teams that have been in the premier league for at least 10 of the previous 22 seasons is 39 points. 39 points typically gaurantees a season that is safe from relegation. However, for the teams with the lower average finaly point tally, such as Sunderland and West Brom, see the lower tails of their error bars treading dangerously close to relegation zone. 

Now, it will be interesting to see how these teams final point tallies will look on the new joyplots from the `ggjoy` package.
```{r final-points-joyplot, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 10, message = FALSE}
season_ending %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  mutate(num_seasons = n(),
         avg_final_points = round(mean(final_points), 0)) %>% #add these columns for filtering and factoring respectively
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(num_seasons >= 10) %>%
  arrange(avg_final_points) %>%
  mutate(team = factor(team, unique(team))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(final_points, team)) +
  geom_joy(scale = 0.9, rel_min_height = 0.01, fill = "red", color = "black", size = 1) +
  theme_tq()+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) +
  labs(x = "Final Points",
       y = "Team",
       title = "Joyplot showing EPL teams' individual season final point tally distribution")

```

The joyplot confirms the conclusions drawn from the bar chart. Manchester United and Arsenal have the highest final point distribution and both have close to a bell curve. However, Chelsea and Manchester City both have much wider distributions as they have much more ups and downs over the past 22 years. 

#Looking at opening weekend results
Since this weekend marks the start of the 2017/2018 season, it will be interesting to see how teams have faired over the last 22 seasons. First, we will start by filtering for the first game of the season. 

```{r first-game-results, results = "hide"}
opening_games <- data_tidy %>%
  group_by(season, team) %>%
  mutate(final_points = max(points), 
         final_goals_for = sum(FTGF), 
         final_goals_against = sum(FTGA),
         table_position = 20 - rank(final_points, ties.method = "min")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(season, team) %>%
  mutate(game = rank(Date)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(game == 1) %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  mutate(final_points_last = lag(final_points),
         final_goals_for_last = lag(final_goals_for),
         final_goals_against_last = lag(final_goals_against),
         final_table_position_last = lag(table_position)) %>%
  ungroup()
